# Electromagnetism Physics Game 

Integrative project for Computer Science and Math DEC at Champlain College. 
Tasked with doing a project based on a subject we learned through our cegep.
What a great opportunity to make another game! Led the project by teaching 2 of my good friends how to use Unity, and together, we scored a 97%:sunglasses:


### Scoring
Collecting the as many neutrons as possible without colliding with an insulator

### Math

  you can notice real-time electromagnetism formulae which dictate the player's proton/electroon state acceleration.
